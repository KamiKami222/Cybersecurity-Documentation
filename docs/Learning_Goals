# Learning_Goals

These are the milestones I plan to achieve in my cybersecurity journey:

## ðŸ“Œ Networking
- Understand TCP/IP and OSI models.
- Understand the main protocols used in each layer.
- Practice with Cisco Packet Tracer to gain more theoretical and practical experience.
- Understand the potential attack vectors in each layer and their mitigation techniques.
- *Practice analyzing traffic with Wireshark.

## ðŸ“Œ APIs
- Learning JSON/YAML basics to be able to work with OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Build strong foundation regarding how APIs work (OpenAPI framework).
- Build and host a local demo API with basic functions and test it with Postman
  *Basic API calls to perform simple network command like Ping,DNS,NSLOOKUP,ETC.
- Explore API security options and integrate them into the demo.
  *API over HTTPS with SSL certificat.
  *Add authentication method - API Keys or JWT.

## ðŸ“Œ Cyber Lab
- Set up a Windows lab with endpoints, firewalls, and IDS/IPS tools.
- Experiment with attack simulations in a controlled environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Tools
- Learn more in-depth Wireshark utilization.
- Learn to use Nmap for network scanning.
- Explore Metasploit for penetration testing.
