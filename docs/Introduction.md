# Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Lior, and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey into cybersecurity.

## Why Cybersecurity?
I've always been intrigues by how famous cyber attacks were carried out. How could they be mitigated? What's the attack point of view (POV) looks like? What's the defender POV looks like? and many more questions.
My curiosity reached it's peak last year and I took a PT course that was my official introduction to the cybersecurity field, while this course wasn't enough to enable me to work as Pentester it provided enough foundation for me to land my first job as a SOC Analyst T1 inside a Emergeny Reponse Team (ERT).
I'll be using GitHub mainly to document my projects and progress in the field and probably more in-depth blogs or documentations on other platform.

I'm always happy to receive feedback and learn from the experts! Feel free to reach out to me!

## Current Goals:
- Build a strong foundation in networking.
- Build strong foundation in APIs and later on API SEC.
- Build knowledge to help me progress in my current role to T2 - DDoS/Web DDoS attacks.
- Document my progress to help others and reflect on my learning.
